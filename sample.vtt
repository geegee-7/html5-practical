00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.040
Today, we're taking a look at how
to make apple pie simple and easy.

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.335
This is an easy recipe anyone could do.

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.280
Everything used on the video, we're
going to leave a link on the description.

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.440
We're using a whole bag of apples.

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.215
This particular bag has nine apples,
and we're using Granny Smith apples.

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.880
But you can use any apple that you like.

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.480
The first First thing that we're going
to do, we're going to go

8
00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.280
ahead and wash our apples.

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.320
Then, let's go ahead and peel them.

10
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.055
But if you feel adventurous today,
and on the daredevil side, you can

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.520
go ahead and peel them with a knife.

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.080
You let them know that not only Rambo
is the only one that can handle one.

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.415
Now that we have our apples peel,
we can go ahead and slice them.

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.960
And how thin or thick you
want them is all up to you.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.695
We like to go on the medium
side so everybody can be happy.

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.255
Remember, you are king or queen or both
of your castles, so those that go against

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.480
the king or queen don't eat today.

18
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.560
Let's go ahead and place
the slices on a bowl.

19
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240
Let's go ahead and start
working on our filling.

20
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.200
We're going to add three quarters of a cup
of white sugar,

21
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.375
one a teaspoon of salt,
three quarters of a teaspoon of ground

22
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.240
cinnamon,
one eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg,

23
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.255
two tablespoons of all-purpose flour or
cornstarch, And lastly,

24
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.480
two tablespoons of lemon juice.

25
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.480
Now, let's go ahead and mix.

26
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.360
And then we can leave it there
for 20 minutes to 45 minutes.

27
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.640
And this is going to get all
the good juices out the apple.

28
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.640
Let's go ahead and take our
butter and cut it in cubes.

29
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.760
And we want to make sure that the butter
is coming out right out of the freezer.

30
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.320
The colder, the better.

31
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.600
We're using a total of two sticks today,
but now we're only going to cut

32
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.880
in cubes one and a half sticks.

33
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.495
Now, let's go ahead and make some pie
crust, and we're going to use the food

34
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.280
processor mixer to get that done.

35
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.720
But now that you feel black belt-like,
you can use two Samurai swords,

36
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.160
two Rambo knives, two forks, or the
deadliest of them all, a pastry cutter.

37
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.720
Let's go ahead and add two cups of all

38
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.880
is flour, one teaspoon of salt,

39
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.760
one teaspoon of baking powder,
one teaspoon of sugar.

40
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.080
We can go ahead and add the butter.

41
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.600
And we're going to pulse it a couple
of times to mix everything in.

42
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.360
Now, we can go ahead
and start adding our water.

43
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.160
And we're going to do
that a teaspoon at a time.

44
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.015
And we want to make sure that the water is
ice cold, so adding a couple

45
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.600
of cubes of ice would go a long way.

46
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.240
We can start by adding
three tablespoons and pulse.

47
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.455
Now, we could turn on the food processor
and start adding one teaspoon of water

48
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.640
until everything is well mixed.

49
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.720
Now, let's go ahead and flour
our working surface.

50
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.160
We can dump our dough,

51
00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.760
sprinkle some more flour

52
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.600
on top and create a disk form.

53
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.535
Now, we can go ahead and place
that on a sip lock bag

54
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.400
on the freezer for 20 minutes.

55
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.480
Now, we can go back to our filling.

56
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.760
Let's go ahead and mix it once again.

57
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.400
As you can see, all the juices
have fall to the bottom.

58
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.535
What we're going to do is go ahead
and drain out that liquid and place it

59
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.560
on a sauce pan because we're
taking it to the stove.

60
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.520
We're going to turn the stove on to medium
low and add 2 tablespoons of corn starch.

61
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.975
Adding the corn starch in a little bit
of water and pre-mixing it before throwing

62
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.640
it in, and it's going
to help you avoid any lums.

63
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.920
And this is going to help
thicken the pie filling.

64
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.000
Once we see the mixture boil,
we're going to turn the stove off.

65
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.600
And now we can add the half a stick
of butter that we use to grease the pan.

66
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.240
And now you can whisk away.

67
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.040
We let the mixture cool for a little
bit and then mix it with the apples.

68
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.960
Let's go ahead and grease the pan.

69
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.920
Let's go ahead and take our dough out
the freezer, dust our working surface,

70
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.855
and we're going to divide the dough on two
pieces because one is for the

71
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.640
bottom and one for the top.

72
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.495
And we're going to place one
back on the freezer again.

73
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.520
Remember to put it inside a siploc bag,
because if not, you can imagine

74
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.200
what your freezer tastes like.

75
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.855
We're going to take our rolling pin
and dust it, and we're going to start

76
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.360
pushing the dough down
and rolling at the same time.

77
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.160
At the beginning, you're
able to flip the dough.

78
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.055
Once it starts stretching,
you won't be able to.

79
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.720
Remember, if you feel the dough that is
sticky, you can add

80
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.680
flour in small amounts.

81
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.920
Our goal is to get the dough one inch or
two inches bigger than the actual pie pan.

82
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.280
Once we get there, we're going to use the
rolling pin to carry the dough to the pan.

83
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.800
And you do that by rolling
the dough slowly to the rolling pin.

84
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.480
And remember, it doesn't
have to be perfect.

85
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.975
Remember that you're going
to place another dough on the top.

86
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.680
We want to fill in all the gaps.

87
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.695
And using your tiny little scissors,
we're going to go ahead

88
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.440
and cut the excess dough.

89
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.295
And we reach the arts and craft part
of the video, where you're going to show

90
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.695
your patience and overall technique to see
if you can get that black

91
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.880
belt you always want.

92
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.760
We're going to crimp the dough all around
using the two-finger method

93
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.295
with the one finger method.

94
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.800
And this is a technique that has been
handed down by generations

95
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.440
and generations, where you crimp
the dough with a deadly one finger touch.

96
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.080
Meanwhile, you hold
the dough with two fingers.

97
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.135
But we know that you can do it,
little grasshopper.

98
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.120
Now, let's go ahead
and add our pie filling.

99
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.240
We don't have to precook the crust because
this might go on the oven

100
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.360
for 45 minutes to an hour.

101
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.960
Let's go ahead and place our bottom
part of the pie on the freezer.

102
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.880
And we want to do this
to keep everything cold.

103
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.760
We can go ahead and turn on our
oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

104
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.560
Let's go ahead and dust our work surface,
bring our our top dough,

105
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.255
and what we're going to do is the same
thing we did with the bottom one.

106
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.720
We're going to roll it out until we have
one or two inches bigger than the pie pan.

107
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.775
Bring out our pie from the freezer
and picking up the dough with the rolling

108
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.200
pin and placing it on top of the pie.

109
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.855
Using our tiny scissors,
cutting off any excess.

110
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.760
And remember, all the dough that remains,
you can make either another

111
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.240
a pie pocket or save it
on the freezer for a later date.

112
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.095
Now that you have practiced the Almighty
finger technique, we can get another

113
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.895
crack at it, crimping the dough.

114
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.200
Remember, it doesn't have to be perfect.

115
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.975
Remember that whoever goes against your
kingdom, just call them and show them this

116
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.640
happy face that you're making on the pie
so they can see how you

117
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.160
control the steel blade.

118
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.640
It's always very important
to let fruit pies ventilate.

119
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.440
That's why we make the holes.

120
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.255
Now you're almost done.

121
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.975
Let's go ahead and take our brush
and eggwash and pass it all over the pie.

122
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.840
If you want to know how to do eggwash,
we're going to leave a link

123
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.760
on the description to that video.

124
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.920
Once we've done that, now we can go
ahead and sprinkle it with sugar.

125
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.200
We think three is the magic number.

126
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.455
But then we said, let's sprinkle it four
times because that's how many

127
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.280
techniques you master today.

128
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.160
You can go ahead and place the pie
on the oven for 20 minutes.

129
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.095
A pro tip, placing a pan with water under
the pie goes a long way because you don't

130
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.575
want to be the one scraping
off that sugar off that oven.

131
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.280
Especially if there's a spouse involved,
you might lose the kingdom

132
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.360
if that happens.

133
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:24.560
After 20 minutes, you want to place
your oven on 375 degrees for 30 minutes.

134
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.175
You can give yourself a pat
in the back for a job well done.

135
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.440
You have become one with the pie.

136
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.880
Now comes the hardest part, letting
that pie rest for 2 hours or until cool.

137
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.800
But if you want a more tastier pie,
leaving it overnight on the fridge,

138
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.080
that's the way to go.

139
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.415
Don't forget, if you like the recipe
try it out.

140
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.560
Bye
